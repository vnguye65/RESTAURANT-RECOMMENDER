# Collaborative Restaurant Recommendation Engine Using NMF and Skyline Queries

Recommendation systems are a well-studied field in data science. Given today’s competitive marketplace, the search for more contextual and personalized user experiences has propelled research in recommendation systems in recent years. Prior studies have extensively improved filtering algorithms used in these recommendation engines to more accurately recommend the most relevant items. This paper applies collaborative filtering and non-negative matrix factorization in a case of a restaurant recommender to make predictions based on similar users’ known preferences. We introduce the concept of skyline query processing as an objective ranking function in a 2-dimensional space, distance and rating. Running a skyline query on a large number of recommendations returns those restaurants representing a good combination of both criteria, highest rating and shortest distance. We present a general framework for building a restaurant recommender that can be served as a road map for future work.
